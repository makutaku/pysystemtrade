# Project Overview

## What is pysystemtrade?

**pysystemtrade** is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade systematic futures trading framework written in Python. It implements the trading methodology outlined in Rob Carver's book ["Systematic Trading"](https://www.systematicmoney.org/systematic-trading) and represents a production system that the author uses for live trading 20 hours a day, 5 days a week with real capital.

This is not an academic exercise or toy system - it's a professional trading infrastructure that handles millions of dollars in systematic futures trading across global markets.
